When making a fix related to an issue on Github, include the URL to the issue. Don't just put #3257 or something like that, use the URL.

Already commented code There are many commented-out sections of code. Moreso than is actually a good idea. Usually theyâ€™re the result of trying many different things before getting to a final/working solution. It also sometimes prevents me from going back and making the same mistake again. This is, of course, bad practice: The former should be fixed with documentation, the latter fixed by heavier reliance on the version control system. However, since one developer is doing the vast majority of the work, I donâ€™t win style points by cleaning up code for people who want to peruse itâ€”and it takes time away if I have to come back and finish debugging a feature (I'm a bit feeble-minded that way). Because development is sporadic, I often have to set something down before it's finished, so I keep the alternate bits around. Also, it's often the case that one version of the code works on one platform (or version of Java) and not another. These go in and out of testing as I move around between platforms.",what to comment,,other->readability->space_indent,what->forbidden->commented_code other->readability->space_indent,other->readability->space_indent

@since should be added to every new class with the version of the framework in which it was introduced
@since should be added to any new public and protected methods of an existing class

The following template summarizes a typical use for the Javadoc of a method.
In particular, please note:
Use an imperative style (i.e. Return and not Returns) for the first sentence.
No blank lines between the description and the parameter descriptions.
If the description is defined with multiple paragraphs, start each of them with <p>.
If a parameter description needs to be wrapped, do not indent subsequent lines (see parserContext).

The Javadoc of a class has some extra rules that are illustrated by the sample below:
Each class must have a @since tag with the version in which the class was introduced.
The order of tags for class-level Javadoc is @author, @since and @see.
In contrast to method-level Javadoc, the paragraphs of a class description are separated by blank lines

The following are additional general rules to apply when writing Javadoc:
Use {@code} to wrap code statements or values such as null.
If a type is only referenced by a {@link} element, use the fully qualified name in order to avoid an unnecessary import declaration.

(Line Wrapping) The one big exception to the above line wrapping rules is Javadoc where we aim to wrap around 80 characters for maximum readability in all kinds of contexts, e.g. reading on Github, on your phone, etc.",what to comment,,what->required->creation_date what->required->@code what->required->@link other->readability->space_indent other->readability->language,what->required->creation_date what->required->@code what->required->@link other->readability->space_indent other->readability->language other->readability->order_of_tags,what->required->creation_date what->required->@code what->required->@link other->readability->space_indent other->readability->language other->readability->order_of_tags

Every class / interface / enum should include a main comment in its beginning, describing:

the purpose of the class
its contents
its usage
and how it is related to other classes.
The main comment should include also the author name (first name and surname, with no abbreviations) and the date when the class was created first.

Each method must be paired with a comment describing its purpose, usage, parameters, return value. In particular, the comment must make explicit as any policies on its use beyond its type signature.

The class and functions (methods) comments specified above should be in Java-Doc format. (Tip: in Eclipse use Alt+Shift+J to generate a javadoc skeleton.)

Comments should be written in the code itself, describing the flow, i.e. describing what the code does. It is required when the code is not clear (i.e. self explaining), and recommended for any long code (long code = code with more that 5 lines).

The best practice is writing in such a way that a programmer that will read your code will be able to understand it, without additional explanations.","where to comment

In the Javadoc comments, describe what the class or interface does.
Every class and nontrivial public method that you write must contain a Javadoc comment with at least one sentence describing what the class or method does. This sentence should start with a third person descriptive verb.
You don't need to write Javadoc for trivial get and set methods such as setFoo() if all your Javadoc would say is ""sets Foo"". If the method does something more complex (such as enforcing a constraint or has an important side effect), then you must document it. If it's not obvious what the property ""Foo"" means, you should document it.
Every method you write, public or otherwise, would benefit from Javadoc. Public methods are part of an API and therefore require Javadoc. Android doesn't enforce a specific style for writing Javadoc comments, but you should follow the instructions in How to Write Doc Comments for the Javadoc Tool.

Use TODO comments for code that is temporary, a short-term solution, or good enough but not perfect. These comments should include the string TODO in all caps
If your TODO is of the form ""At a future date do something"" make sure that you either include a specific date (""Fix by November 2005"") or a specific event (""Remove this code after all production mixers understand protocol V7."").

If a comment line contains an example command or a literal URL longer than 100 characters, that line may be longer than 100 characters for ease of cut and paste.

elastic/elasticsearch,"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#javadoc","Good Javadoc can help with navigating and understanding code. Elasticsearch has some guidelines around when to write Javadoc and when not to, but note that we don't want to be overly prescriptive. The intent of these guidelines is to be helpful, not to turn writing code into a chore.

The short version
Always add Javadoc to new code.
Add Javadoc to existing code if you can.
Document the ""why"", not the ""how"", unless that's important to the ""why"".
Don't document anything trivial or obvious (e.g. getters and setters). In other words, the Javadoc should add some value.
The long version
If you add a new Java package, please also add package-level Javadoc that explains what the package is for. This can just be a reference to a more foundational / parent package if appropriate. An example would be a package hierarchy for a new feature or plugin - the package docs could explain the purpose of the feature, any caveats, and possibly some examples of configuration and usage.
New classes and interfaces must have class-level Javadoc that describes their purpose. There are a lot of classes in the Elasticsearch repository, and it's easier to navigate when you can quickly find out what is the purpose of a class. This doesn't apply to inner classes or interfaces, unless you expect them to be explicitly used outside their parent class.
New public methods must have Javadoc, because they form part of the contract between the class and its consumers. Similarly, new abstract methods must have Javadoc because they are part of the contract between a class and its subclasses. It's important that contributors know why they need to implement a method, and the Javadoc should make this clear. You don't need to document a method if it's overriding an abstract method (either from an abstract superclass or an interface), unless your implementation is doing something ""unexpected"" e.g. deviating from the intent of the original method.
Following on from the above point, please add docs to existing public methods if you are editing them, or to abstract methods if you can.
Non-public, non-abstract methods don't require Javadoc, but if you feel that adding some would make it easier for other developers to understand the code, or why it's written in a particular way, then please do so.
Properties don't need to have Javadoc, but please add some if there's something useful to say.
Javadoc should not go into low-level implementation details unless this is critical to understanding the code e.g. documenting the subtleties of the implementation of a private method. The point here is that implementations will change over time, and the Javadoc is less likely to become out-of-date if it only talks about the what is the purpose of the code, not what it does.
Examples in Javadoc can be very useful, so feel free to add some if you can reasonably do so i.e. if it takes a whole page of code to set up an example, then Javadoc probably isn't the right place for it. Longer or more elaborate examples are probably better suited to the package docs.
Test methods are a good place to add Javadoc, because you can use it to succinctly describe e.g. preconditions, actions and expectations of the test, more easily that just using the test name alone. Please consider documenting your tests in this way.
Sometimes you shouldn't add Javadoc:
Where it adds no value, for example where a method's implementation is trivial such as with getters and setters, or a method just delegates to another object.
However, you should still add Javadoc if there are caveats around calling a method that are not immediately obvious from reading the method's implementation in isolation.
You can omit Javadoc for simple classes, e.g. where they are a simple container for some data. However, please consider whether a reader might still benefit from some additional background, for example about why the class exists at all.
Not all comments need to be Javadoc. Sometimes it will make more sense to add comments in a method's body, for example due to important implementation decisions or ""gotchas"". As a general guide, if some information forms part of the contract between a method and its callers, then it should go in the Javadoc, otherwise you might consider using regular comments in the code. Remember as well that Elasticsearch has extensive user documentation, and it is not the role of Javadoc to replace that.
Please still try to make class, method or variable names as descriptive and concise as possible, as opposed to relying solely on Javadoc to describe something.
Use @link and @see to add references, either to related resources in the codebase or to relevant external resources.
If you need help writing Javadoc, just ask!
Finally, use your judgement! Base your decisions on what will help other developers - including yourself, when you come back to some code 3 months in the future, having forgotten how it works.","what to comment

Do not leave commented out code in the source files. Just remove it.

There are some exceptions of course, such as: ""When I'm pretty sure it needs re-enabled at some point, and to make sure I don't forget why that is, I leave a clear TODO comment, e.g. ""TODO this needs re-enabled when TRUNK-XXXX is fixed"". Most IDEs are good at parsing out all TODO statements."" Rowan Seymour

All classes and interfaces should, at a minimum, have a Javadoc comment at the class level
Public methods should have a Javadoc comment
Please note that the commenting style from most textbooks is only a good practice when the comments are intended for a student learning to program. It is not intended for professional programmers. Take a look at these best practices for commenting your code.
Code that performs any non-obvious task should be documented for clarification

Use both the @Deprecated annotation and the @deprecated javadoc comment

Javadoc
Javadoc is used to build a code reference for our public site. It is generated as part of the build. There are three places where Javadoc should be provided by the developer of Java code:

Every Java source file should begin with a header javadoc tag just before the start of the class/interface/enum, which explains the purpose and responsibilities of the code.
All public methods should have a clear Javadoc header describing the purpose, parameters and results (including exceptions). This includes test cases.
Each Java package should include a package-info.java file describing the purpose of the package and its content.
Java code files may have additional comments, particularly where the processing is complex. The most useful comments are those that describe the purpose, or intent of the code, rather than a description of what each line of code is doing.

The output from a build should be checked to ensure there are no javadoc warnings - for example about undocumented parameters or exceptions.","where to comment

Robolectric uses Markdown Doclet, so write javadoc using markdown, with javadoc tag extensions.

For developers with the Robolectric Chrome Extension installed, javadoc on Robolectric shadow classes and methods are inserted into developer.android.com sections for the classes and methods they shadow, and identified as Robolectric-related testing notes. Javadoc on visible, non-@Implementation methods on shadow classes are displayed in a new â€˜Testing APIsâ€?section for the shadowed class.

There are special rules for javadoc on shadow classes to support the Robolectric Chrome Extension:

All @Implementation methods whose behavior varies from the standard Android behavior MUST have Javadoc describing the difference. Use @see or {@link} to indicate if the methodâ€™s behavior can be changed or inspected by calling testing API methods. If the methodâ€™s behavior is identical to the normal framework behavior, no javadoc is necessary.
All visible non-@Implementation methods SHOULD have descriptive Javadoc.

https://github.com/twitter-archive/commons/blob/master/src/java/com/twitter/common/styleguide.md","The more visible a piece of code is (and by extension - the farther away consumers might be), the more documentation is needed.
Documentation for a class may range from a single sentence to paragraphs with code examples. Documentation should serve to disambiguate any conceptual blanks in the API, and make it easier to quickly and correctly use your API. A thorough class doc usually has a one sentence summary and, if necessary, a more detailed explanation.
A method doc should tell what the method does. Depending on the argument types, it may also be important to document input format.
Don't document overriding methods (usually)
No author tags
Code can change hands numerous times in its lifetime, and quite often the original author of a source file is irrelevant after several iterations. We find it's better to trust commit history and OWNERS files to determine ownership of a body of code.

Leave TODOs early and often
A TODO isn't a bad thing - it's signaling a future developer (possibly yourself) that a consideration was made, but omitted for various reasons. It can also serve as a useful signal when debugging.

Leave no TODO unassigned
TODOs should have owners, otherwise they are unlikely to ever be resolved.

Classes, methods and ï¬elds should have a block comment describing them if it makes sense. There is no need to add comments merely for the sake of commenting. For example, it is not necessary to add a comment for a method if the comment does not provide more information than the signature and the method name already do.
JavaDoc comments must not be copied from methods that are being overriden. If the comment from the method that you are overriding is suï¬ƒcient, you do not need to provide JavaDoc for the newly added method - JavaDoc will automatically copy the JavaDoc from the overriden method. If you want to extend the comment from the overriden method with new information, use @inheritDoc to copy the comment from the superclass and add your text.
JavaDoc for methods contains a short description of their arguments (using @param), the return value (using @return) and the exceptions they may throw (using @throws).
