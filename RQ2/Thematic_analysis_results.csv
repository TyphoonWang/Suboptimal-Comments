     * current item in the array being hashed, adds a large non-prime used in LightRNG's generation function,
     * multiplies by a prime called the ""state multiplier"", adds the result to the state and stores it,
     * multiplies the value of the state by another prime called the ""output multiplier"", then XORs the current
     * result with that value before moving onto the next item in the array. This all can be done very quickly;
     * a million hashes of a million different 16-element long arrays can be computed in under 18-20 ms (in the
     * benchmark, some amount of that is overhead from generating a new array with LongPeriodRNG, since the
     * benchmark uses that RNG's state for data, and the default Arrays.hashCode implementation is only
     * somewhat faster at under 16 ms). After several tries and tweaks to the constants this uses, it also gets
     * remarkably few hash collisions. On the same 0x100000, or 1048576, RNG states for data, Lightning gets
     * 100 collisions, the JDK Arrays.hashCode method gets 136 collisions, Sip (implementing SipHash) gets 145
     * collisions, and CrossHash (using the FNV-1a algorithm) gets 146 collisions. Dispersion is not perfect,
     * but at many bit sizes Lightning continues to have less collisions (it disperses better than the other
     * hashes when more bits are available, at least on this test data). Lightning also does relatively well,
     * though it isn't clearly ahead of the rest all the time, when hashing Strings, especially ones that use
     * only a small set of letters, it seems (FakeLanguageGen was used to make test data, and languages that
     * used fewer characters in their alphabet seemed to hash better with this for unknown reasons).
     * state multiplier ""Neely's number"", which is a probable prime made by taking the radix-29 number
     * right by 42 bits. This version uses ""Neely's number"" for an initial state, and uses a different probable
     * prime as the state multiplier, made with a similar process; it starts with the radix-36 number
     * ""EDSGERWDIJKSTRA"", then does the same process but rotates right by 37 bits to obtain a different prime.
     * This tweak seems to help with hash collisions. Extensive trial and error was used to find the current
     * output multiplier, which has no real relationship to anything else but has exactly 32 of 64 bits set to
     * 1, has 1 in the least and most significant bit indices (meaning it is negative and odd), and other than
     * that seems to have better results on most inputs for mystifying reasons. Earlier versions applied a Gray
     * code step to alter the output instead of a multiplier that heavily overflows to obfuscate state, but that
     * had a predictable pattern for most of the inputs tried, which seemed less-than-ideal for a hash.
     * <br>
     * The output multiplier is 0xC6BC279692B5CC83L, the state multiplier is 0xD0E89D2D311E289FL, the number
     * added to the state (from LightRNG) is 0x9E3779B97F4A7C15L, and the starting state is 0x632BE59BD9B4E019L.
     * <br>
     * Vitally, Lightning avoids predictable collisions that Arrays.hashCode has, like
     * {@code Arrays.hashCode(new long[]{0})==Arrays.hashCode(new long[]{-1})}).

Additionally some code from the ACG is transfered in a Helper that manges labels, scopes and variable creation in a stack. All checks from JSRVariableScopeCodeVisitor are transfered into the ClassCompletion verifier or the new VariableScopeVisitor. Additionally some checks for labels were added with the LabelVerifier. ACG was changed so a DeclarationExpression will no longer create a local variable and if a variable is a filed or protperty accessed from inside a closure ACG will no longer try to access that field directly. Instead the closure has to resolve these cases at runtime.

Instead, HiddenMarkovModelSegmentProcessor directly gives viterbi results (calculations are done on worker nodes). - added a method to ForwardBackwardAlgorithm to calculate the log data likelihood excluding emission lines (only the chain); this is useful in reporting the correct log likelihood in variational Bayes problems after updating some posteriors that affect emission probability, though, still using the old copy ratio posteriors - improved concordance statistics report in CoverageModellerGermlineSparkToggleIntegrationTest - extra unit tests for Nd4j-related methods - updated unit test resources

Many times the documentation of attributes and parameters just repeated the name of the attribute itself. Some methods didn't have a clear explanation of their goals or lacked some important details that were included. Some ambiguous terms such as ""machine"", that can mean a ""virtual"" or a ""physical machine"", where accordingly changed by the specific term to avoid confusion. Some methods also had ambiguous meanings. Methods such as getUtilization of the UtilizationModel class return the utilization percentage of some resource. Other methods such as getUtilizationOfRam on HostDynamicWorkload class returns the absolute value of a resource usage (not percentage), what is not accordingly described in the documentation. These inconsistencies were corrected in the documentation.

                        // and its end is covered by the same word, we will end up visiting these objects although there were pushed on the

",,"\Fixed bugs that caused references pushed on the marking stack to be visited twice. The problem originates from the way the mark bitmap is scanned. The mark word needs to be reread after every visit to a cell corresponding to a grey mark in order to catch grey mark that may have been set in that same word. Some of these marks may be before the current ""finger"", causing their reference to be pushed on the marking stack by the cell visitor, but visited immediately after by the mark bitmap scan. This happens because the scan of the mark bitmap word doesn't check if a grey bit is before the finger or not.

Cleaned up MetadataStore and MetadataRetrieve interface usage:     * Renamed OMEXMLMetadataStore to OMEXMLMetadata.     * Created MetadataTools utility class with conversion methods between       OMEXMLMetadata, OME-XML string, and other (""foreign"") MetadataStore       and MetadataRetrieve object types.     * Migrated existing convertMetadata(MetadataRetrieve, MetadataStore)       method from FormatTools to MetadataTools.     * Also included useful reflection methods for working with OMEXMLMetadata       objects without depending on loci.formats.ome package at compile time.     * Reworked places that uses OMEXMLMetadata objects via reflection to use       new MetadataTools utility methods instead.     * Reworked OMETiffReader and OMETiffWriter to be more flexible about       their assigned MetadataStore and MetadataRetrieve objects, respectively;       using the MetadataTools convertMetadata functionality, even foreign       metadata object implementations are usable.   2. Eliminated a few catch-all exception handling blocks, but still some left.   3. Some miscellaneous cleanup and tweaks.   4. Given the scope of the changes, I probably broke something.

","\Implemented Operations to simplify get indexes and find and modify (find & remove/replace/update).  As part of this work:   - Refactored write operations so that they no longer require a Command.  Command is being phased out in favour of containing the functionality in Operations classes.   - This meant changing classes further up the stack to deal only with Documents without wrapping them in a Command, simplifying the code in most places   - Created a DocumentHelper to make creation of things like command documents a lot simpler   - Greater test coverage for the areas affected by the new operations; also added tests to areas affected by refactoring   - Moved creation of Settings objects into MongoClient classes, a refactoring that makes creating tests for the operations a lot simpler   - Created CommandWithPayloadEncoder and CommandResultWithPayloadDecoder to allow correct use of custom encoders for find and replace/remove/update.  Find and Replace now works with custom types.   - Fixed Exceptions for command results that return a custom type   - Ignored a Find Bugs warning for all classes, since it was adding nothing and was ignored for all classes it was found in

","\Removed Graph.of(). TraversalStrategies are not 'emanating object class'-dependent, not dependent on the Traversal class. Simplied caching model and removed the need for vendors to provide DefaultXXXGraphTraversal implementations. Removed Traversal.SideEffect.getGraph(). It is unsafe to store the graph in the sideEffects of the traversal (OLAP .. serialization). Simplified Traversal interfaces to use core start() methods. Was able to gut lots of methods in tinkerGraph, HadoopGraph, and Neo4jGraph as now we can just rely on default methods in core interface.

Thus I've created a isValidZipURL() method and thus I've added a unit test for it showing the bug).

","\Several improvements in documentation of classes from the package org.cloudbus.cloudsim. The documentation of classes, methods and attributes were improved to make them clearer. Many times the documentation of attributes and parameters just repeated the name of the attribute itself. Some methods didn't have a clear explanation of their goals or lacked some important details that were included. Some ambiguous terms such as ""machine"", that can mean a ""virtual"" or a ""physical machine"", where accordingly changed by the specific term to avoid confusion. Some methods also had ambiguous meanings. Methods such as getUtilization of the UtilizationModel class return the utilization percentage of some resource. Other methods such as getUtilizationOfRam on HostDynamicWorkload class returns the absolute value of a resource usage (not percentage), what is not accordingly described in the documentation. These inconsistencies were corrected in the documentation.
